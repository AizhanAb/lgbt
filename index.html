         LGBT Issues in Kyrgyzstan</h1>

<p>Same-sex sexual activity was decriminalized in 
Kyrgyzstan in 1998, but the Kyrgyz lesbian, gay, 
bisexual, and transgender  (LGBT) community 
experiences routine discrimination and violence. 
Despite human rights guarantees enumerated in the 
Kyrgyz Constitution, LGBT individuals in practice do 
not enjoy the same liberties as heterosexual 
citizens.</p>
<p>The Jogorku Kenesh (Kyrgyz parliament) is currently 
considering a law that would exacerbate this 
inequality by severely curtailing the basic freedoms 
of  LGBT people and their allies. Emulating Russia’s
2013 law banning <code>“homosexual propaganda,”</code> it 
poses a threat to the human rights of the LGBT 
community in the country and the region at large.
The bill now awaits its third and final reading in the 
Kyrgyz parliament. If it passes, it will be sent to 
President Almazbek Atambayev, who must decide 
whether to sign the legislation or veto it.</p> </section>
     
     <section class="main-section" id="Facts_about_the_Bill">
<header ><h3 >Facts about the Bill</h3></header>
<ul> 
  <li><p>The bill is more severe than the Russian 
law; it seeks to ban the dissemination of all 
public information that portrays <code>“non traditional sexual relations” </code> in a positive 
light, not just information that is presented to
minors. The bill also contains harsher 
penalties, including prison terms of up to 
one year, in addition to administrative fines. 
It is the first bill of its kind in the region that 
    seeks to incarcerate LGBT individuals.</p></li>
 <li><p>If passed, the bill would severely impede the 
essential work of LGBT organizations and 
limit the freedoms of speech, expression, 
and assembly of activists, civil society 
leaders, journalists, and members of the 
   LGBT community.</p></li>
<li> <p>The bill has received overwhelming support 
in the Jogorku Kenesh. The last reading of 
the bill was approved by a vote of 90-2. 
Proponents have simultaneously ramped up 
homophobic rhetoric. Baktybek 
Kalmamatov, a member of parliament, 
referred to LGBT people when he stated:
<code>“"Who are they…to be protected? They are 
damaging me, my children. I loathe them, 
they should not eat in the same places we 
  eat at, sit where we rest.”</code></p> </li>
  <li><p> In June 2015, the Kyrgyz Minister of Justice 
issued a statement calling for removal of the 
legislation from consideration; she argued 
that the bill runs counter to basic human 
rights, as enshrined in the country’s 
constitution. Despite the statement, support 
    for the bill remains strong in parliament.</p> </li>
  
<li><p> Activists warn that the law could be used to 
blackmail members of the LGBT community 
and repress LGBT people and activists more 
generally, given the vague definition of
  propaganda.</p></li>

<li><p> Members of the Kyrgyz LGBT community 
have experienced increased hostility since 
the introduction of the bill, including violent 
attacks. Police have reportedly already 
detained individuals for violating the bill, 
  even though it is not yet law.</p> </li>
<li> <p>The bill, if passed, could have serious 
implications for public health, as it would 
directly conflict with programs to prevent and 
stem the spread of HIV/AIDS.</p></li>
<li> <p>Passage of such a law in Kyrgyzstan, a 
country sometimes described as an island of 
democracy in Central Asia, could have 
negative implications for other countries in 
  the region considering similar legislation.</p></li></ul>

       <ul>
<li> <p>The U.S. Embassy in Bishkek should build 
on its successes by continuing to meet with 
and share resources with the Kyrgyz LGBT 
community. Additionally, Secretary of State 
John Kerry, U.S. Special Envoy for the 
Human Rights of LGBTI Persons Randy 
Berry, and U.S. Ambassador Sheila 
Gwaltney should raise concerns over the bill
in bilateral engagements with Kyrgyz 
leadership. Discussions should be framed in 
the context of human rights, basic freedoms, 
and nondiscrimination.</p></li>
<li><p> U.N. member states should encourage 
Kyrgyz leadership to honor their 
commitment to the protection of human 
rights. Kyrgyzstan is currently a member of 
the United Nations Human Rights Council 
and recently supported a United Nations 
resolution calling for the promotion and 
protection of human rights defenders. The 
bill, if enacted, would violate the 
commitments in that resolution.</p></li>
<li><p> The United States should partner with the 
Council of Europe to promote its leverage, 
particularly given the Kyrgyz parliament’s
status as a <code>“Partner for Democracy”</code> within 
the council’s Parliamentary Assembly. Such 
partnership should include dialogue with the 
Kyrgyz government on respect for human 
rights, fundamental freedoms, and 
nondiscrimination, inclusive of LGBT issues.</p></li>
<li><p> American businesses with interests in 
Kyrgyzstan should encourage Kyrgyz 
government leadership to promote a safe 
environment for their employees and the 
general public through respect for human 
rights and basic freedoms.</p></li>
<li><p> The World Bank should engage with Kyrgyz 
leadership to stress that the passage of any 
law marginalizing the LGBT community 
would contribute to structural inequalities in 
the country, thus undermining development 
efforts. The Bank has asserted that the 
advancement of human rights is a central 
goal of development and should highlight 
this message in dialogues with President 
  Atambayev and the Kyrgyz parliament.</p> </li></ul>

<code>"Members of Parliament try to hide behind a wall of 
family values, religion, and tradition to encourage 
the escalation of violence and the consolidation of 
discrimination against the LGBTQI community at a 
legislative level. Community representatives are 
already regularly subjected to threats, blackmail, 
bullying and violence; they remain invisible. …Now 
is our chance to raise our voices, to make ourselves 
heard and change national policy. We as activists 
don’t have the right to stop fighting or to give up. 
We must always remember those standing behind 
us, waiting to be seen and heard."</code>
–Ruslan Kim, LGBTIFAQ organization Kyrgyz Indigo
